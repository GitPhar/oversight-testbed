# Pre-registration deviations

## D1 — Contentions come from the visible written reasoning, not the hidden thinking trace

**Date:** 2026-11-03 (before any pool, calibration, or test-set result existed)

**Original spec:** ask the base model with extended thinking on, capture the thinking trace, and split the hidden thinking trace into 5–16 discrete contentions.

**New design:** the base model is asked to reason step by step *in its visible response* before giving `FINAL ANSWER: YES/NO`. Only that visible written response goes to the contention extractor. Thinking stays on (adaptive, effort `xhigh`) so the model still deliberates. Its content is requested with `display: "omitted"`, so it is never returned, stored, or passed to any other call. Only the thinking token count is logged.

**Reason:** in the first pool attempt, the API's `reasoning_extraction` safeguard refused the extractor call (`claude-sonnet-5-5`, `stop_reason: refusal`), which was being handed the base model's thinking trace. We redesigned the pipeline rather than route around the safeguard. If any call in the pipeline is refused again, the run stops, records the refused call and its exact stop details in `results/refusal.md`, and does not reword or retry.

**Effect on interpretation:** the circuits encode the argument the model *wrote down*, which may be a tidied, post-hoc account of its deliberation rather than the deliberation itself. Every result in this repository should be read as being about the written reasoning.

### Findings that led here (pilot calls, 2026-11-03)

1. **Sonnet 5.5 emits no thinking block at all at `low`, `medium`, or `high` effort** on these items (tested on a bat-and-ball item and a letter-counting item). Adaptive thinking judged them not worth thinking about, so there was no trace to split. A thinking block appeared only at `xhigh` and `max`.
2. **Even at `xhigh`, the thinking block is only a short summary**, one or two sentences (67–98 thinking tokens on the pilot items), and the raw chain of thought is never exposed. It could not have supplied 5–16 contentions on its own.

## D2 — The redesigned extractor was refused too (run stopped)

**Date:** 2026-11-03

With D1 in place (base thinking requested with `display: "omitted"`, extractor given only the question and the visible written response), the first extractor call (q01) was refused again with `stop_reason: refusal`, category `reasoning_extraction`. Per the hard rule, the run stopped at once. Nothing was reworded or retried, and 0 of 60 questions completed. The refused call and its exact stop details are in `results/refusal.md`.

The prompt still had the shape the safeguard documents as a trigger: the input sat inside a tagged `<response>` section, and the system prompt asked for the writer's "deliberation" / "written reasoning" to be decomposed.

## D3 — Prompt redesigned per Anthropic's documented guidance for reasoning_extraction

**Date:** 2026-11-03 (before any pool, calibration, or test-set result existed)

Anthropic's [refusals documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback#keep-reasoning-in-thinking-blocks) says `reasoning_extraction` fires on prompt *shape*:
- a `<thinking>`, `<reasoning>` or scratchpad section
- a `reasoning`, `thinking` or `trace` field in JSON output
- the model's private notes, or a running log of its reasoning
- reasoning asked for verbatim or in full

It also says that asking for a short explanation or the evidence behind a result is fine, and that the category has no fallback model. The fix is to change the prompt.

Both earlier designs had that shape. D1's base prompt asked the model to "reason step by step in writing". Both extractor prompts wrapped the input in a tagged section and asked for the writer's reasoning or deliberation to be split out.

**Redesign:**
- **Base call** (`claude-sonnet-5-5`): adaptive thinking at `xhigh`, `display: "summarized"`. The prompt asks for the answer plus a brief explanation of the main considerations for and against, and keeps the `FINAL ANSWER: YES/NO` line. There is no step-by-step instruction and no tagged section. The summarized thinking blocks and the visible answer are saved together as each question's **deliberation record** in `results/pool-run-1.json`. The thinking blocks are archived only and are never sent to any other call.
- **Extractor** (`claude-sonnet-5-5`): the visible answer is presented as a document: "Below is a short written argument answering a yes/no question." It lists the document's distinct claims as `claims[{text, confidence, lean}]`.
- **Relation judge** (`claude-haiku-5-5`): the input is a numbered list of claims, and the output is the pair table `pairs[{i, j, relation, strength}]`.
- Every string sent to the API (prompts, schemas, user templates) was checked for thinking / reasoning / trace / scratchpad / deliberation / step-by-step / tag markup and reworded where any appeared.

**Science impact:** unchanged from D1. The circuits encode the claims in the model's *visible* explanation, which is a short account of its considerations, not its internal deliberation.

If a call is refused after this redesign, the run stops and records the request ID and exact refusal in `results/refusal.md`. The next step is a support ticket. Nothing will be iterated further.

## D4 — Pool extended with 75 code-verified computational items

**Date:** 2026-11-03 (after the pool run, before any circuit was run on any pool item)

**What happened:** on the original 60-item pool, `claude-sonnet-5-5` at effort `xhigh` answered **all 60 correctly**. With no known-wrong items, the 10-wrong / 10-right test set cannot be formed and H2 cannot be tested.

**Change:** the pool was extended once with 75 yes/no items generated by `experiments/make_extension.py` (seed 404, `experiments/questions_extension.json`). The items are:
- primality of 8-digit numbers (primes vs. products of two 4-digit primes)
- Gregorian weekdays of dates from 1600 to 2400
- letter counts in sentences
- digit sums of powers of 2
- 5-digit × 5-digit products with near-miss claims
- prime counts in 100-wide intervals

Every answer is computed by the script, not hand-labelled, so a "wrong" model answer cannot be a labelling error on our side.

**Rule fixed in advance:** the base effort stays at `xhigh`, and the extension is used once. If the 135-item pool still yields fewer than 10 wrong items, the run stops and that is reported. Otherwise the split follows the pre-registration: 10 wrong and 10 right items at random (seed 2026), with everything else, including surplus wrong items, going to calibration. The calibration pool is therefore about 115 items, not 40.

**Effect on interpretation:** the wrong items will be mostly computation slips, not misconceptions or conjunction-fallacy errors. The experiment then asks whether the circuit flags the model's *calculation* errors. That is a narrower question than the original one about conflicting beliefs.

**D4 addendum (same day, before any extension item completed):** at `xhigh` effort, the first computational item made the base call think until it hit the 16,000-token cap, which costs about $0.16 per call. To stay inside the $10 budget:
- items are processed in shuffled order;
- a base call that hits the cap is recorded as *no answer* and excluded from the split, never counted as wrong;
- the extension stops as soon as the pool holds 13 wrong items, or when session API spend reaches $8.50.

This stopping rule shapes only which items exist. It is applied before any circuit is run, so it cannot select for any hypothesis.

## D5 — Base model changed to claude-haiku-5-5 to obtain errors

**Date:** 2026-11-03 (before any circuit was run on any pool item)

**Original spec:** base model `claude-sonnet-5-5`, with adaptive thinking run at effort `xhigh` (D1).

**What happened:** pool run 1 with `claude-sonnet-5-5` at `xhigh` answered **all 117 checkable items correctly**: the 60 original items plus 57 of the computational extension items. Another 10 extension items hit the 16,000-token cap and were excluded. The run was stopped before its last 8 extension items once this decision was made. With no known-wrong items, H2 cannot be tested. Run 1 is archived as `results/pool-run-1.{json,md}`.

**Change:** the base model is now `claude-haiku-5-5`, a weaker Claude model chosen to obtain errors. It runs at its **default** effort, with adaptive thinking and `display: "summarized"`. The extractor (`claude-sonnet-5-5`) and the relation judge (`claude-haiku-5-5`) are unchanged.

Pool run 2 covers every original and extension item except the 10 that hit the token cap in run 1. The test set is 10 wrong and 10 right items at random (seed 2026), and the rest form the calibration pool.

**Fallback, fixed in advance:** if Haiku gets fewer than 10 wrong, the test set is every wrong item plus the 10 correct items whose extracted claims give the model's answer the least net support (Σ confidence·lean / Σ confidence, signed toward the answer given). Stage 2 runs anyway, and the results state plainly that H2 is underpowered at that count.

**Unchanged:** the H2 criterion, the five arms, the encoding, the readout and the threshold rule.

Nothing extracted under run 1 can be reused, because contentions depend on the base model's own answer. Run 1's spend stays in `results/api-usage.md`.

## D6 — Second, harder question pool (Stage 2 run 2)

**Date:** 2026-11-03 (after Stage 2 run 1 was fixed and running, before any hard-pool result existed)

**Why:** the standard pool of trick puzzles, misconceptions and computation yielded only 4 known-wrong items on `claude-haiku-5-5`, out of 125. At that count H2 is underpowered.

**New pool:** `experiments/questions-hard.json`, 300 yes/no items, 150 yes and 150 no, built by `experiments/make_hard_pool.py` (seed 1729). Every item records its source and license.
- **120 SimpleQA items** (OpenAI simple-evals, MIT). Each is the question plus a candidate answer: the gold answer for half the items, and for the other half the gold answer of a different SimpleQA question with the same topic and answer type.
- **120 MMLU-Pro physics and chemistry items** (TIGER-Lab, MIT). Each is the stem plus either the correct option or a random wrong one. Stems that depend on seeing the option list are dropped. GPQA Diamond was not used: it is gated, and its authors ask that items not be published in plain text, which this public repository would do.
- **60 author-written claims**: 30 true and 30 plausible fabrications, each a near-miss of a true fact.

**Pipeline:** unchanged, with the same base prompt, extractor, judge, encoding, readout, threshold rule, arms and H2 criterion.
- The hard pool runs first through `claude-haiku-5-5` (pool run 3).
- If Haiku gets fewer than 30 wrong, the pool also runs through `claude-sonnet-5-5` at default effort (pool run 4), and both result sets are kept.
- An answer with no parseable `FINAL ANSWER` line is excluded, not counted as wrong.

**Split:** all wrong items (at most 40, at random), plus an equal number of right items at random (seed 2026). Everything else is the calibration pool.

**Budget:** $15 for runs 3 and 4 together, enforced in code.

## D7 — Pre-registered additions: arms F and G, bootstrap intervals, a 200-shuffle null for arm D

**Date:** 2026-11-03, written after Stage 2 run 2 was committed and before Stage 2 run 3 data were collected.

Two arms were added: **F**, the classical Ising twin of arm A, and **G**, the base model's self-reported confidence. Two statistics were added for every arm: AUROC with 95% bootstrap intervals, and a 200-shuffle null distribution for arm D in place of the single shuffle. Full definitions are in `experiments/preregistration.md`, Addendum A.

They are first applied as a re-scoring of run 2 (`results/stage2-run-2b.md`). Arms A–E are not re-run. H2 is unchanged, and the F/G comparison is reported alongside it.

## D8 — Witness run: readout calibration pinned to the measured qubits

**Date:** 2026-11-03, before submission.

`experiments/witness.md` specifies readout-calibration circuits "on the same two physical qubits". `witness_design.py` passed those circuits through the optimizing transpiler, which is free to move them onto other qubits. `experiments/witness_run.py` instead builds them directly on the physical qubits that each item's settings measure. They use only native gates (`x`, `measure`) and are submitted untranspiled.

The noisy-simulator prediction is recomputed with this corrected calibration and reported next to the hardware result. Circuits, settings, shots and pass rule are otherwise exactly as designed: 39 circuits, 4,000 shots each, one Batch. Sean approved the budget of about 45 QPU seconds.

## D9 — v2 training pool

**Date:** 2026-11-03 (before any v2 fitting, and before the v2 split existed)

**Pool:** `experiments/questions-train.json`, 598 yes/no items (302 yes, 296 no), built by `experiments/make_train_pool.py` (seed 2718). Every item records its source and license. The pool leans toward errors that come from deliberation rather than ignorance:
- **150 SimpleQA items.** None are reused from the hard pool.
- **200 MMLU-Pro items**: 50 each from biology, engineering, physics and chemistry. The Hugging Face `/filter` endpoint was still failing, so biology and engineering rows were paged through the public `/rows` endpoint, using the dataset's category blocks.
- **150 two-sided computed puzzles**, with every claim placed 3–15% above or below the exact value (fractions):
  - base rates
  - sampling without replacement
  - birthday problems
  - expected values
  - three-dice totals
  - a conditional coin
  - combinations
  - average speed (the harmonic-mean trap)
  - compound growth
  - power comparisons
- **98 code-verified claims**: element numbers and symbols with near-miss false versions, plus computed numeric facts with small off-by-one or near-miss false versions.

**Leakage guard:** any item whose question stem also appears in the run-2 hard pool is dropped. Two element claims duplicated hard-pool claims and were removed. The run-2 hard pool, and in particular its 80-item test set, stays a separate held-out set.

**Run:** base model `claude-haiku-5-5` with the unchanged pipeline (pool run 5). The budget is $20, enforced in code. The target is at least 120 wrong items.

**Split:** the train / validation / test split (60/20/20, seed 2026, stratified by wrong/right × item type) is locked in `experiments/split-v2.json` and committed before any fitting.

## D10 — QPU-seconds parsing bug (fixed)

**Date:** 2026-11-03

IBM Runtime reports a job's billed QPU time as `metrics()["usage"]["qpu_charge_time_seconds"]`. `backends.run_hardware` read `quantum_seconds`, which doesn't exist in this runtime, so it logged the Stage 1 job as 0.0 s when it had used 2 s.

`backends.qpu_seconds` now reads the correct key. `backends.repair_ledger` recomputed every ledger entry from the stored raw metrics, so the 420 s hard stop sums correctly.

The witness job had already been submitted with the old code, so its ledger entry is repaired the same way when it returns.

**D9b addendum: one supplement to the training pool (same day, before the split was locked and before any fitting).**

Partway through pool run 5, Haiku's errors came almost entirely from SimpleQA (20% wrong) and MMLU-Pro engineering, physics and chemistry (12–20%). It got 0 of 82 computed puzzles wrong, 0 of 48 verified claims, and 4% of biology items. The full pool would yield about 55 wrong items, against the target of at least 120.

One supplement of 450 items was added as t599–t1048 (`make_train_pool.py --supplement`, seed 2719):
- 300 MMLU-Pro items: 100 each from engineering, physics and chemistry. Science is the larger share, following the brief's "deliberation over ignorance" weighting.
- 150 SimpleQA items.

The supplement excludes every existing training item and the held-out hard pool. The original 598 items are unchanged.

Also handled in this addendum: an item whose explanation yields fewer than 5 claims after one retry is now recorded as excluded, not counted as wrong, instead of crashing the run. This happened once.

**Finding:** the two-sided computed puzzles do not elicit errors from Haiku 5.5. Its errors on this pool are ignorance-type (SimpleQA) and multi-step science, not the base-rate or harmonic-mean traps.

## D11 — Experiment 4 (quantitative Yearsley & Trueblood) pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-03, before any experiment-4 call.

Pre-registered in `experiments/exp4-yearsley-trueblood.md`, with items in `experiments/exp4-items.json`. Choices made at pre-registration:

1. **Items.** Only 4 co-occurrence items exist in `items-borrowed.json`, too few for a share-based rule. They were joined by the 4 Linda variants that convert cleanly to X/Y form (Bill, Priya, the analytical person, name-swapped Marta) and by 8 new author-written items (co05–co12), for 16 in all.
2. **Letter-copying check.** Swapping the A/B labels on both questions together cannot detect a model that copies its first *letter*: under any shared mapping, a repeated letter is also a repeated content answer. The check therefore uses crossed mappings, where Q1 and Q2 use different label mappings, and compares how often the content answers agree under same versus crossed mappings.
3. **"Beyond repetition."** The classical comparator is Kang (2026)'s symmetric repetition model, fitted per item, which predicts o_rep = r · (p_X − p_Y). The quantum claim is tested on o − o_rep as well as on o.
4. **Thinking disabled for the base calls,** following the borrowed protocol's "thinking off". The base model is `claude-haiku-5-5`.

The budget is $10, enforced in code. The experiment runs last in the queue.

**D11 addendum: R2 wording corrected (same day, before any experiment-4 call).** Rule R2 (the order effect is at least the fallacy size) is a consequence of the quantum model, but it is not unique to it. An updating classical model, in which each judgment updates the state before the next, also satisfies R2. Only the *static* classical twin is ruled out.

The overstated sentences were corrected in `experiments/items-borrowed.json` (rule R2 and the pre-registerable test) and in `experiments/exp4-yearsley-trueblood.md`. In experiment 4, meeting R2 is now read as "consistent with quantum or sequential-update classical; rules out the static twin", not as support for the quantum account. The pass rules' thresholds are unchanged.

## D12 — Version two pre-registered (before any fitting)

**Date:** 2026-11-03. The split was locked in `experiments/split-v2.json` (train 629 with 95 wrong, validation 210 with 31 wrong, test 209 with 32 wrong; stratified, seed 2026) and committed before this pre-registration. Both came before any fitting. Choices made here:

1. **Pass criterion.** "Exceeds the classical twin's AUROC by more than the width of both bootstrap 95% intervals" is read as **non-overlapping intervals**: A2's lower 95% bound must be above F2's upper 95% bound. The paired bootstrap difference is reported as well.
2. **Equal parameter counts.** A2 and F2 each have 8 scored parameters plus a flag threshold. To match that, L uses the 5 features named in the brief plus 3 more relation-web summaries (number of related pairs, mean |lean|, and the share of confidence leaning against the vote), giving 8 weights plus a flag threshold. L's bias term is left out because AUROC does not depend on it.
3. **Fitting uses exact noiseless statevector scores** (`v2.fast_quantum_probs`, verified equal to the Qiskit circuit at v1 values to 10⁻¹⁶). This makes A2 the strongest version of the quantum model. A noisy-simulator fit at about 1,000 train evaluations was not computationally feasible. The classical twin F2 is also exact.
4. **Shared fitting rule:** 400 random draws, then hill-climbing of the 10 best with 60 steps each (1,000 train evaluations), with the final candidate selected on validation AUROC. Seeds are A2 101, F2 202, L 303.
5. **Arm G** (self-reported confidence) needs one Haiku call per locked-test item. It is made at evaluation time and cached in `results/v2-arm-g-confidence.json`. On the run-2 held-out set it reuses the existing arm-G calls.
6. **Phase solver.** `v2.solve_phases_fast` is a vectorised form of `encoder.solve_phases`, with the same starts and update rule plus early stopping. It agrees within 2×10⁻⁶ rad. v1's solver is unchanged.

## D13 — Experiment 3 implementation choices (logged before any experiment-3 result)

**Date:** 2026-11-03

1. **Budget:** $10, as set in Sean's run instruction. This replaces the $4 cap written in the pre-registration. The expected cost of about $2.60 is unchanged.
2. **Secondary test 1 (do order effects exist at all?)** The pre-registration compares order effects with baseline split-halves. It is implemented as a permutation test that shuffles the order labels within each item-pair. This compares the observed |P(yes | i first) − P(yes | j first)| with what run-to-run variability alone produces, using the same 5 + 5 conversations. The 5 single-turn baseline runs per item are still collected and reported.
3. **Secondary test 2 (do the largest-Δᴼ pairs show bigger effects than the smallest?)** The pre-registration says paired Wilcoxon over items. It is implemented as a sign-flip permutation test on the per-item difference, because scipy is not a dependency.
4. **Exact U_k.** In the yes/no (X) basis, H_k's coupling and field terms are diagonal and −Z_k flips qubit k. So U_k = exp(−iγ₀H_k) is applied as exact 2×2 rotations, one for each configuration of the other qubits, with no truncation. This was checked to preserve the norm to 10⁻¹².

## D14 — Pre-registered additions: hedge baseline H and version 2.1 "honest hedge" encoding

**Date:** 2026-11-03 17:45 MST, before any test-set evaluation of v2 (the v2 fit was still running on train and validation).

These were added at Sean's request, prompted by the exploratory window vignette W4 (`paper/window-vignettes.md`), which notes that the encoding forces hedging claims into a yes or no camp. Full definitions are in `experiments/preregistration-v2.md`, Addendum B.

**Choices made here:**
- A no-lean claim is defined as |lean| ≤ 0.1. This was set from the train split's lean distribution only.
- The H primary score is the total confidence of no-lean claims, with H-count reported alongside.
- In v2.1, hedges are fixed at phase π/2 with lean 0, and are left out of the phase solver while keeping their couplings.
- The uncertainty term is U = confidence share of hedges, with a learned weight λ_h in [0, 2].
- A2.1 and F2.1 each have 10 parameters, matched to each other.
- v2.1 is evaluated on the locked test set once, after the v2 arms.

Because W4 was an exploratory observation on run-2 data, v2.1 is a hypothesis suggested by data from the run-2 hard pool. Its evaluation on the **run-2 held-out set** is therefore not independent of that suggestion. The **locked v2 test set**, which shares no item with run 2, is the clean test.

## D15 — Correction: the phase solver's frame drifts off the yes/no axis (encoding bug, documented and characterised)

**Date:** 2026-11-03. Prompted by Sean's frame check on window item h046. The work is exploratory and uses run-2 data only. It does not touch the locked v2 test set.

**Finding.** Two causes were possible: (a) a display convention error in `export_window.py`, or (b) the encoding itself. It is **not (a)**: the exported encode-stage Bloch azimuth equals the solver's φ exactly, claim for claim. It **is (b)**, in a more specific form than a free rotation.

The XY energy E(φ) = −Σ J_ij cos(φ_i − φ_j) − Σ lean_k cos φ_k is pinned by its lean anchors, so it cannot rotate freely. But the anchors are weak, with weight 1, against the relation couplings. The relation judge marks "supports" between claims that lean opposite ways when one makes the other more plausible. Those couplings pull the yes and no camps toward each other, and the ground state settles at a compromise off the readout axis. The energy is also symmetric under φ → −φ, so the direction of the tilt is arbitrary.

On h046, the yes claims sit at −62° and −71° and the no claims at −137° to −174°. Across the 225 run-2 items that have both camps:
- 20% have the yes camp more than 30° off axis;
- 20% have camps less than 90° apart;
- at least 10% have fully merged camps.

**Fix 1, a rigid frame pin (`encoder.pin_frame`), does not work.** It applies the least-squares rotation putting the yes camp at 0° and the no camp at 180°. A rotation only fixes a frame that has rotated, so it cannot pull merged camps apart. It changed nothing material.

**Fix 2, the correction: stronger anchors (`encoder.solve_phases_anchored`).** In the phase solve only, the lean field is scaled by λ = max(1, the largest total coupling Σⱼ|J_kj| of any claim in the item). This rule was fixed before its AUROC was computed. Effects:
- yes camps more than 30° off axis fall from 20% to 7%;
- the 10th-percentile camp separation rises from 0° to 147°.

The λ → ∞ limit, which puts every leaning claim exactly on the axis, is reported for reference.

**Effect on error detection, exploratory.** Exact noiseless scores on the run-2 test set:

| arm | as run | with the correction | at λ → ∞ |
|---|---|---|---|
| A0 | 0.49 [0.35, 0.62] | 0.47 [0.34, 0.61] | 0.47 [0.33, 0.60] |
| C | 0.68 [0.56, 0.79] | 0.67 [0.55, 0.78] | 0.67 [0.54, 0.78] |

Details are in `results/frame-fix-check.md`. The frame bug is real, but it does not explain the entangled arm's poor error detection.

**Disposition.**
- v1, v2 and every archived result keep the as-run solver, as pre-registered.
- Following Sean's rule ("if the fix matters, it goes into v2.1"), the correction is **not** added to v2.1, because it does not change the AUROCs. v2.1 stays a single change, the honest hedge. The v2.1 fit had not started when this was decided, so the correction could still be folded in, as a correctness fix, by a pre-registered amendment before `fit21`.
- `export_window.py` needs no fix.

## D16 — v2.1 amendment: fit noiseless, evaluate noiseless and on the noisy simulator

**Date:** 2026-11-03 18:36 MST, before any v2.1 fit or any test-set evaluation.

At Sean's instruction (`experiments/preregistration-v2.md`, Addendum C):
- A2.1 and F2.1 are fitted on exact noiseless statevectors and selected on validation.
- The selected models are evaluated once on the locked test set, noiseless, and A2.1 is also evaluated once on the noisy `ibm_fez` simulator (1,000 shots per item).
- F2.1 has no circuit, so it has only the noiseless evaluation.
- The pass criterion is applied to the noiseless comparison, with the noisy result reported alongside.
- Everything else in Addendum B is unchanged.

## D17 — Experiment 4 run 2 (graded form) pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-03 19:06 MST, before any run-2 call. Full design: `experiments/exp4-yearsley-trueblood.md`, "Addendum — run 2".

At Sean's request, the order test is re-run on run 1's 7 fallacy items with graded 0–100 ratings in both orders, 20 repeats per cell. Choices made here:
- Temperature is the model default (1.0); no explicit parameter is sent, because the API rejects one for this model.
- The graded analogue of "beyond repetition" is anchoring of the second rating on the first, fitted by regression.
- q_QQ and Γ are dropped, because they are defined only for binary answers. The marginal shifts OE_X, OE_Y and OSS are kept.

## D18 — Second base model (claude-sonnet-5-5): replication set-up

**Date:** 2026-11-03, before any Sonnet replication call.

At Sean's request, the hard pool (pool run 4, already defined in D6) and the training pool (new pool run 6) are run through `claude-sonnet-5-5` as base, at default effort with adaptive thinking. The extractor and judge are unchanged.

G, L, H and the **already-fitted** A2 and F2 are scored on Sonnet's errors, using the frozen v2 parameters in `results/v2-fit.json`. Nothing is refitted.

**Budget.** At about $0.02 per item, both pools (1,348 items) would cost about $27, against Sean's $15 budget. So:
- the pool runs are capped at $12 together and arm G at $3, both enforced in code;
- run 4 (the full hard pool) goes first;
- run 6 processes the locked v2 test questions first, so a budget stop still covers them, then as much of the rest as the budget allows.

What actually ran is reported in `results/sonnet-replication.md`.

## D19 — Experiment 4 run 2: the pre-registered anchoring estimator is near-tautological (logged after results)

**Date:** 2026-11-03, after run 2's results.

The pre-registered "beyond repetition" analogue regresses the second rating on the first across cells X→XY and Y→XY pooled. Because those two cells differ mainly in their first-rating means, the slope r ≈ o / (P(X) − P(Y)), so o − o_rep ≈ 0 regardless of mechanism. The run's verdict, "static classical twin (with anchoring) supported", is reported as pre-registered, but the results file says plainly that it does not show anchoring explains the effect.

An exploratory within-cell slope, using repeat-to-repeat variation only, cannot be estimated reliably either: at the default temperature the rating standard deviation is 0.00–0.05.

**Lesson for experiment 5 and later runs:** estimate anchoring only within cells, or manipulate the first rating directly.

## D20 — Sonnet replication stopped on a reasoning_extraction refusal

**Date:** 2026-11-03

During pool run 4 (hard pool, base `claude-sonnet-5-5`), the **extractor** call for question `h101` was refused with `stop_reason: refusal`, category `reasoning_extraction`. The request ID is `req_011Cgh7v49vVQNR6AgY3EDui`.

This is the first refusal since the D3 redesign. The same extractor prompt had run on 1,473 Haiku-based items without a refusal (pool runs 2, 3 and 5), and on 102 Sonnet-based items in this run before `h101`.

**Action, per the hard rule:**
- The run stopped at once, and nothing was reworded or retried.
- The record is in `results/refusal-sonnet-replication.md`, which is a copy of `results/refusal.md`.
- The next step is a support ticket with the request ID, which Sean will file.
- The Sonnet replication (D18) is halted at 102 of 300 hard-pool questions (12 wrong, $1.39), and pool run 6 was not started.
- No further Anthropic calls will be made until Sean decides how to proceed.

## D21 — Sonnet replication resumed with h101 excluded

**Date:** 2026-11-03, at Sean's decision, after D20.

Question `h101`, whose extractor call was refused (`reasoning_extraction`, request ID `req_011Cgh7v49vVQNR6AgY3EDui`), is **dropped** from pool run 4. It is recorded in `run_pool.REFUSAL_EXCLUDED`, and nothing was reworded or retried. The remaining hard-pool items and pool run 6 (the training pool) continue with the extractor unchanged.

If a second refusal occurs, the run stops again and is reported. The support ticket is filed separately, from `results/refusal-sonnet-replication.md`.

## D22 — Experiment 5 pre-registration frozen; pilot-item clarification

**Date:** 2026-11-03 20:15 MST, before any experiment-5 call.

`experiments/exp5-sequential-judgment.md` is frozen in its own commit, at Sean's go-ahead, with a $4 cap. One clarification was made at freezing:
- §7.1's "next 2 right" pilot items do not exist under the 5-per-category cap, which admits exactly the 20 selected right items across the 4 categories.
- The pilot therefore uses the next 2 right items in the uncapped ranking (h001, h170), alongside the next 3 wrong (h018, h088, h039).
- Re-running §3's selection rule from `results/pool-run-3.json` reproduces §9's 40 ids exactly and in order.

Nothing else in the design was changed.

## D23 — Experiment 5 implementation choices (fixed before any experiment-5 call)

**Date:** 2026-11-03, after the freeze (D22) and before the pilot. These are details the frozen text leaves open:

1. **Sub-question order.** S₁…S₄ are the four chain claims in claim-index order. O1–O4 follow the cyclic Latin square 1234, 2341, 3412, 4123. X_k omits S_k from O1.
2. **Turn structure.**
   - The first user turn is the opening context followed by the first question.
   - Each answer is structured output: {"rating": int} for ratings, {"answer": "yes"|"no"} for K1's choice, and {"reply": "continue"} for K0's filler.
   - A schema failure is recorded, and its row is dropped in analysis.
3. **Split arithmetic.** 384 chains at 60/20/20 is 230.4/76.8/76.8. Stratified by chain type (32 chains each), every type gets 19/6/6. The 12 leftovers are assigned by largest remainder, 2 to train, 5 to validation and 5 to test, at random with seed 2027. That gives exactly 230/77/77.
4. **G1's SD criterion** is computed over cells (chain type, rating position, anchor direction), with the SD taken across repeats within one anchor direction. This stops scale reversal from inflating dispersion.
5. **G2.** A pair passes if, in at least one order, the binarised minority share of either of its two questions (S_k or M) is at least 10%.
6. **Phase solver check (§5.1)**, run before freezing the split, with a maximum difference of exactly 0 in both cases:
   - the composed solver against `solve_phases_anchored`, on the 116 items with no hedges;
   - the composed solver against `v2.hedge_phases`, using a plain solve, on all 300 items.

## D24 — Experiment 5: pilot item h001 has only 3 competing claims

**Date:** 2026-11-03, before any experiment-5 call. The run raised an error while building the job list, so no API call had been made.

§3 states that all 40 candidates have at least 4 competing claims, and they do. The pilot item `h001`, chosen under the D22 clarification, has only 3. For any item with fewer than 4, the 4th chain slot is filled with the leaning, non-competing claim with the highest confidence × |lean|. This affects `h001` only. The 40 candidates' chain claims are unchanged, which was checked against `split-exp5.json`. Pilot data are never used in any test.

## D25 — Sonnet replication stopped on a second reasoning_extraction refusal

**Date:** 2026-11-03

- **Pool run 4** (hard pool, `h101` excluded) completed: 299 items processed, 1 hit the token cap, and **30 were wrong**. Cost $4.07.
- **Pool run 6** (training pool, locked-test questions first) then stopped on question `t368` (a SimpleQA item). The **extractor** call was refused with category `reasoning_extraction`, request ID `req_011CghAdzJQ9nFBMocCLUMhf`. 82 items had completed, 7 of them wrong, for $1.10.

Per Sean's rule ("if a second refusal occurs, stop again and report"):
- Nothing was reworded or retried.
- The replication is halted.
- The scorer (`sonnet_replication.py`) was **not** run, because its arm-G step would make further Sonnet calls.

The record is in `results/refusal-sonnet-replication-2.md`. Both refusals came on SimpleQA items with Sonnet as the base model, after 1,473 Haiku-based and 381 Sonnet-based items had gone through the same extractor prompt without one.

## D26 — Experiment 5 model details left open by the frozen text (fixed before any full-run data were examined)

**Date:** 2026-11-03. The full run was collecting data, unread, while these were fixed. Code: `experiments/exp5_models.py`.

1. **κ in A5.** κ scales the prep RZZ(κJ) and the evolution couplings by κ/κ₀, with κ₀ = π/4. So A5⁰ (κ = π/4, γ = 0.5, β = 0.4) reproduces v1's coupling strengths in both places.
2. **Evolution steps.** Every turn gets one evolution step before it, including K1's choice and K0's filler. The filler gets the step only, with no update.
3. **Π_M.** It has eigenvalue 1 for vote m > 0, 0 for m < 0 and ½ for m = 0, matching the readout's tie rule. The POVM and the choice updates use √ of these eigenvalues.
4. **D5 in practice.** In the yes/no basis the coupling and field terms are diagonal phases, so after dephasing only the mixer moves populations. D5 is therefore A5's prepared populations evolving by independent bit flips with probability sin²β per qubit per step. That is still exactly the dephased model, with 5 parameters, of which γ has no effect.
5. **F5 hedges.** A hedge has no "true" direction, so it is given a prior P(x = +1) = ½. Hedges are never asked about.
6. **BA5's parameter boxes**, which the text does not give: ω_supp, ω_con ∈ [0, 2] and ρ ∈ [0, 1]. C₀ is A5⁰'s prepared P(yes), before any evolution step. The "side" of a claim is the sign of its lean, compared with the model's original answer.
7. **The ablation, A5 with κ = 0,** is refitted with κ pinned at 0, under the same rule and budget (seed 505). The plain-solver sensitivity run, A5plain, is also refitted (seed 506).
8. **Rows with a schema failure.** A conversation containing one is excluded whole, and the count is reported.

**D26 addendum (before any full-run result):** in §7.5's verdict, "a signature contradicted" covers two cases: the QQ signature contradicted (mean-q CI excluding 0 on the large-OE pairs), **or** Kvam's commitment outcome (Δ_K CI entirely above 0, the opposite sign to the quantum prediction). The rest of the verdict table is applied as written.

## D27 — Sonnet hard pool scored offline, arm G not scored

**Date:** 2026-11-03, at Sean's request, after D25.

L, H, A2 and F2 were scored on Sonnet's 298 archived hard-pool records (pool run 4, `h101` excluded), using the frozen v2 parameters. The run used `sonnet_replication.py --offline`, in which every API client is blocked in code, and no call was made.

Arm G is marked **not scored**, because it needs Sonnet calls and the replication is halted. The 82 training-pool records of pool run 6 were not scored either, because Sean's instruction covered the hard pool.

## D28 — Addendum D (coupling ablation, F2+) and arm G on Sonnet's hard pool

**Date:** 2026-11-03 21:03 MST, before any ablation score or any Sonnet arm-G call.

- **Addendum D** (`experiments/preregistration-v2.md`): A2(κ=0) frozen, and F2+ (F2 plus A2's per-claim tilted-readout marginal, 10 parameters against A2's 9) fitted on the v2 train split. Each is scored once on Haiku's locked test set and on Sonnet's 298 hard-pool records, with the decision rule fixed in advance.
- **Arm G on Sonnet** (Sean's instruction): one self-confidence call per hard-pool item to `claude-sonnet-5-5`. This is the base model, not the extractor, and it sees only its own visible answer. The budget is $2, enforced in code. Any refusal stops the run and records the request ID, with nothing retried.

## D29 — Dates use local America/Denver time throughout

**Date:** 2026-11-03, at Sean's instruction.

Some documents carried 2026-11-04 for work done on the evening of 2026-11-03 Denver time: the UTC date, or a wrong date. Git's local timestamps (MST, UTC−7) are the reference. From now on, every date in the repository is local.

**Corrected:**
- D14 and D15 above;
- the writing dates of Addenda B and C in `experiments/preregistration-v2.md`;
- the writing date of `experiments/exp5-sequential-judgment.md`.

The two pre-registration files are frozen. **Only the expression of the date changed; no instant and no word of the design.** For example, "2026-11-04 00:45 UTC" became "2026-11-03 17:45 MST", which is the same moment. The exp5 text's "Written 2026-11-04" was simply wrong: it was written at 19:19 MST on 2026-11-03 (`2dc435b`).

Also corrected:
- `experiments/exp4-run-3.md`, `paper/next-steps.md`, `paper/the-entangled-mind-v3.md` and `paper/references.bib` (a comment);
- the hand-written Reading section of `results/stage1-run-1.md`.

**Not changed:**
- machine-written UTC fields in `results/` (the IBM usage ledger, the job-status log, the calibration tables) and in archived JSON, which their writers produce and `experiments/reproduce.py` checks byte for byte. Switching those writers to local time is a code change, logged separately if made;
- commit messages, which cannot be edited. One says "2026-11-04" (`34f5de4`).

## D30 — Addendum E: the frozen F2+ on Haiku's run-2 held-out set

**Date:** 2026-11-03 21:49 MST (the commit time of `52e80a0`). Pre-registered in `experiments/preregistration-v2.md`, Addendum E (`52e80a0`), before the scoring, at Sean's go-ahead.

The frozen F2+ was scored once on the run-2 held-out set (40 wrong, 40 right), with no refitting and no API calls. Its AUROC was 0.80 [0.69, 0.88]:
- F2+ − A2 = −0.019 [−0.073, +0.029];
- F2+ − A2.1 = −0.037 [−0.089, +0.012];
- F2+ − F2 = +0.088 [+0.014, +0.167].

**Outcome 1:** Haiku's held-out edges are also single-claim readout geometry, carried by a classical model. Results are in `results/sonnet-ablation.md` (Addendum E section) and `results/heldout-f2plus.json`.

## D31 — Machine-written timestamps switched to America/Denver

**Date:** 2026-11-03, following Sean's rule (relayed with D29) that every date in the repository uses local America/Denver time.
- The IBM usage ledger keeps UTC in its JSON, but `results/ibm-usage.md` now shows local time.
- `results/ibm-calibration.md`'s "Job ran at" line is now MST: Stage 1 ran at 16:06 MST, which is 23:06 UTC.
- `check_job.py` now writes local time. The existing `results/ibm-job-status-log.md` was converted once, and its instants are unchanged.
- Both tables were regenerated from their archived JSON by their writers, so `reproduce.py` still matches byte for byte.

## D32 — Experiment 5 analysis fix: tolerance in the a priori QQ sub-test (found after results)

**Date:** 2026-11-03, after experiment 5's first results were written.

The a priori sub-test compares order effects on each item's two QQ pairs, ordered by predicted non-commutativity |sin Δφ|. The analysis first compared these values with exact floating-point inequality. After the anchored phase solve, almost every chain claim's |sin Δφ| is 0 up to solver round-off (10⁻¹⁶–10⁻⁹), so round-off decided which pair counted as "larger". That gave a spurious 28 wins to 9 losses (p = 0.001) over "37 items".

Treating differences of 10⁻⁶ or less as ties, the tolerance already used for the encode-stage non-commutativity count, leaves 3 items with genuinely distinct predictions: 1 win, 2 losses, p = 0.875. The markdown was regenerated from the archived JSON, and nothing was refitted.

The pre-registered design is unchanged, and so is the verdict, which does not use this sub-test. The selection of QQ pairs for the many items whose claims all sit at |sin Δφ| = 0 was made by `qq_pairs` before any data. It is therefore effectively arbitrary on those items, which is consistent with §8.6's expectation that most claims commute.

## D33 — Experiment 4 run 3 frozen with a one-scale amendment; experiment 5 single-scale re-run pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-03 22:59 MST, before any call in either run.
- **Experiment 4 run 3** (`experiments/exp4-run-3.md`): frozen with an amendment.
  - Every rating prompt states one scale direction, "0 = certainly false, 100 = certainly true", per experiment 5's anchor finding.
  - The provided values A are fixed from archived means (`experiments/exp4-run-3-anchors.json`).
  - If r₁ is collinear with A, the fit falls back to two parameters (β₂ unidentified).
  - The point values used in the rules are fixed.
  - Budget $2, enforced in code.
- **Experiment 5 run 2** (Addendum in `experiments/exp5-sequential-judgment.md`): B0 and the QQ block re-run on the first 10 candidates, anchor (a) only.
  - It is descriptive, with no refitting, and the reading is fixed in advance.
  - Budget $1, enforced in code.

## D34 — Overnight gold-map run, 1 of 6: direction 9 (NSIT on archived experiment 5 data) pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 03:48 MST (the commit time of `7f0dd3e`), before the analysis. Sean's overnight brief runs six gold-map directions in order, each pre-registered in its own commit before its first call, every new design on one scale direction only, with stop-on-refusal for every call.
- **Direction 9** (`experiments/gm9-nsit.md`) is a $0 analysis of the archived experiment 5 conversations. It uses anchor (a) only, six NSIT families, a within-cell permutation test, and Holm correction.
- **Results files** for the overnight run open with a hand-written "In plain English" section. `reproduce.py` excludes that section from its comparison, as it already does for "## Reading".

## D35 — Overnight run, 2 of 6: direction 3's free look (anchor-direction gap against errors) pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 03:50 MST (the commit time of `a1bc421`), before the analysis.
- `experiments/gm3a-anchor-gap.md`: a $0 analysis of the archived experiment-5 B0 conversations.
- **Primary score:** the per-item |gap| between the two scale directions. **Primary statistic:** its AUROC for the model's hard-pool errors.
- This is the only overnight analysis that uses both scale directions, because the gap between them is its subject. The directions are compared, never pooled.

## D36 — Overnight run, 3 of 6: direction 1 (self-versus-other confidence) pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 03:52 MST, before any call. Recorded in `experiments/gm1-self-knowledge.md`.

**Changes from the gold map's sketch,** made before freezing on the literature session's full-text reads:
- **Primary statistic: the judge × author interaction.** I = self cells − cross cells. It replaces "a positive self advantage on both authors", because judge capability dominates per-author comparisons (Xiao et al. 2509.24988, Table 23). The per-author advantages are still reported.
- **Matched framing on the originals.** All four cells are run fresh with one "another assistant" prompt, so self and cross cells differ only in authorship. The archived "you gave" self ratings are used for a framing comparison.
- **The paraphrase arm has its own recognition check.** Panickssery et al. only proposed a paraphrase control and never ran one.
- **The disagreement subset means the authors' correctness differs** (Ashuach et al.): 26 questions.

**Budget and stops:** $3, enforced in code. The steps run in a fixed order, so a cap stop truncates the least important step. The run stops on any refusal.

**Timestamps:** D34 and D35 were corrected to their commit times (03:48 and 03:50) per the America/Denver rule. The literature session flagged both.

### D36 amendment — direction 1's run order, made while step 1 was running and before steps 3 and 4 ran

**Date:** 2026-11-04 03:58 MST.

**The problem.**
- The matched-framing Sonnet calls cost about $0.0037 each, against the $0.003 assumed from D28. The judge writes more about another assistant's answer.
- At that rate, steps 1–4 would total about $3.30, over the $3 cap.

**The change.**
- The run was stopped after step 2 completed. Both steps are cached, and no call was lost.
- It restarts in a new order:
  1. Haiku's recognition calls (120 calls, about $0.02);
  2. step 3, the paraphrase 2×2;
  3. Sonnet's recognition calls, for as long as the cap allows.
- The cap stays at $3. Nothing else in the design or the analysis changes.
- If Sonnet's recognition check is truncated, the results report how many of its calls ran.

## D37 — Overnight run, 4 of 6: direction 2 (shown, redacted and planted transcripts) pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 03:58 MST, before any call. Recorded in `experiments/gm2-self-conditioning.md`, with the planted values fixed in `experiments/gm2-planted-values.json`.

**Design.**
- First 10 experiment-5 items; chains O1–O4 and MF; anchor (a) only.
- Four conditions, 10 conversations each.
- Budget $1, enforced in code; stop on any refusal.

**Change from the gold map:** planted values are **±15** points rather than ±30, on the literature session's full-text read of Kumaran et al. 2507.03120.
- A planted answer must be plausible and must sit in the model's own turn.
- In experiment 4 run 3, the model rejected provided ratings 30 points away.

**Primary:** R = OE_redacted / OE_shown, with an item-bootstrap CI read against 0.5. A permutation gate checks first that the shown condition has an order effect.

## D38 — Overnight run, 5 of 6: direction 3's six-format run pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 04:02 MST, before any call. Recorded in `experiments/gm3b-format-invariance.md`.

**Design.**
- The 160 chain claims × 6 formats × 10 repeats, on Haiku with thinking disabled.
- Budget $1, enforced in code; stop on any refusal.

**Changes from the gold map.**
- **The reversed 0–100 scale is replaced by a 7-point verbal scale,** per the overnight rule of one scale direction in every design.
- **The model comparison is a 2-fold held-out-repeat log-likelihood** of one credence per claim (L1) against one per claim and format (L6).
- **The "CbD-style consistency test" is not attempted.** The formats have no shared outcome space.
- **The precedent is cited:** Smolin & Wilder 2609.07943, which found single latents fit capable models well. The gold map's P falls from 0.45 to 0.25.

**Check before freezing.** The fitting code was tested on simulated data.
- With one latent and monotone links, ΔLL was −8.2 per claim and 0% of claims were positive.
- With format-specific latents, ΔLL was +36 and 100% were positive.

## D39 — Overnight run, 6 of 6: direction 4 (the evidence-seeking menu test) pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 04:05 MST, before any call. Recorded in `experiments/gm4-evidence-seeking.md`. The menus and per-claim scores are fixed in `experiments/gm4-menus.json`, built by `experiments/gm4_menus.py`.

**Design.**
- The 40 items × 3 menus × 10 repeats, on Haiku with thinking disabled.
- Budget $0.50, enforced in code; stop on any refusal.

**Additions from the literature session's reads.**
- A most-uncertain baseline, to check whether EIG is confounded with the most uncertain-sounding claim.
- Jhaveri et al.'s confirmatory-testing finding, as the expected alternative.
- The gold map's P falls from 0.25 to 0.20.

**Check before freezing.** The analysis code was tested on simulated choices.

### D36 amendment 2 — direction 1 crashed on a token-cap judge call; lost calls bounded, cap tightened

**Date:** 2026-11-04 04:07 MST.

**What happened.**
- In step 3 (the paraphrase 2×2), one Haiku judge call hit max_tokens: 4,000 tokens, with the arm-G default thinking. It was not a refusal.
- The runner treated it as a crash. Calls completed after the last cache save (at 1,600 calls) were lost, along with the token-cap call itself.
- The last save was at 04:05:14 and the crash at 04:05:30. At the run's measured rate, that is about 30–50 calls of about $0.003, so **at most $0.20**.
- Recorded spend is $2.558, so true spend is at most about $2.76.

**Changes.**
- **The cap** is now $3 minus that $0.20 bound, enforced as $2.80 of *recorded* spend. The truncation order is unchanged: the rest of step 3, then Sonnet's recognition check.
- **A token-cap judge call** is recorded as no rating and dropped from its cell. This follows the project's existing rule for token-cap answers (stage 1).
- **The lost calls are re-issued** with identical parameters, because they have no record. One of them is the token-cap call: it was not refused, and its identity was not recorded.
- **The shared runner** (`experiments/gm_common.py`) now saves its cache every 50 calls and on any error, and stops cleanly. This applies to the remaining overnight runs.

## D40 — Biomimetic run, 1 of 5: confidence-gated confirmation on the archived run-3 calls pre-registered; revision-2 criteria adopted for all five

**Date:** 2026-11-04 05:08 MST, before `results/exp4-run-3-calls.json` was opened for this analysis.

**Sean's instruction.** After direction 4, merge the biomimetics branch, then run five tests in this order:
1. the three $0 analyses (confirmation on the run-3 calls, serial-position weights, contrast sign on the single-scale QQ data);
2. the sampling identity ($0.05);
3. serial dependence with run 3's anchors as the model's own answer ($0.23).

Each is pre-registered before its archive is opened or its first call, on one scale direction throughout.

**Revision 2 of the map.** Sean's list follows revision 1 of `paper/biomimetic-map.md`. The branch as merged carries revision 2 (`f824e14`, 04:27), in which full reads corrected these tests. The five tests are run as Sean listed them, at his budgets, with revision 2's corrected criteria wherever it corrects them:
- **Confirmation:** consistency is coded by sign relative to 50, as primary. It is read as a low-power test that does not single out confirmation.
- **Serial position:** the U-shape exclusion is the LCA's falsification test.
- **Contrast sign:** run as a descriptive assimilation/contrast check. It is not a normalization test, because sequential normalization is untested in the source paper.
- **Sampling:** the item-level Z slope is primary, and Z ≈ 0 is secondary.
- **Serial dependence:** own > other is the source test, and the "sign flip by source" prediction is withdrawn.

Revision 2's other recommendations are not run, because Sean did not list them:
- K1/K0 sensitivity;
- the variance shape as a separate $0 analysis (it is reported inside the sampling run);
- the distance and lag cells;
- the prime × confidence test.

**Recorded in:** `experiments/bm3-confirmation.md`.

## D41 — Biomimetic run, 2 of 5: serial-position weights pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 05:08 MST, before the archive was opened for this analysis. Recorded in `experiments/bm7-serial-position.md`.
- The data are experiment 5's O1–O4 chains, anchor (a) only.
- Position weights are fitted with item fixed effects.
- The primary reading is revision 2's U-shape exclusion for the LCA.

## D42 — Biomimetic run, 3 of 5: contrast or assimilation on the single-scale QQ data pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 05:08 MST, before the archive was opened for this analysis. Recorded in `experiments/bm9-contrast.md`.
- The data are the QQ conversations on anchor (a): run 1 is primary and run 2 is the replication.
- The test regresses the shift in M on the level of the S rating, with the content push as a covariate.
- It is not a normalization test (map revision 2, §3.10).

## D43 — Biomimetic run, 4 of 5: the PT+N identity and its Z slope pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 05:09 MST, before any call. Recorded in `experiments/bm2-sampling-identity.md`.

**Design.**
- 16 exp-4 items × 4 statements × 20 repeats, on one scale.
- Budget $0.10, enforced in code; stop on any refusal.

**Primary test:** the item-level Z slope (map revision 2), with **split halves**. A check on random ratings before freezing showed that shared repeat noise alone gives b ≈ +0.95 without the split.

**Secondary test:** mean Z within ±0.05.

## D44 — Biomimetic run, 5 of 5: source dependence (run 3's anchors as the model's own answer) pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 05:11 MST, before any call. Recorded in `experiments/bm1-serial-dependence.md`.

**Design.**
- Run 3's 16 items and ±30 anchors, with each anchor planted as the model's own earlier answer. The comparison is run 3's archived "another person" cells.
- R = 40; one scale.
- Budget $0.40 (estimate $0.23), enforced in code; stop on any refusal.

**What it shares with direction 2 (D37):** the planted value sits in the model's own assistant turn, in its structured-output format, with the same model and settings. Direction 2's result, and biomimetic tests 1–4, were known at freezing.

**Readings (map revision 2):**
- own > other means source-dependent self-consistency;
- attraction from both sources means stimulus-history serial dependence;
- revision 1's sign-flip prediction is withdrawn.

## D45 — Robustness wave, 1 of 3: direction 2 on all 40 experiment-5 items pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 06:30 MST, before any call. Recorded in `experiments/gm2b-self-conditioning-40.md`, with the planted values fixed in `experiments/gm2b-planted-values.json`.

**Design.** Identical to D37.
- The 10 items already run are reused as archived; the other 30 are run now, at about $1.6.
- Budget $2.50, enforced in code; stop on any refusal.

**Planted M values for the 30 new items** come from run-1 anchor-(a) first turns identical to B0, because run 2's B0 covers only the first 10.

**Reporting.** Primary on all 40, with two further sets:
- replication on the 30 new items;
- sensitivity without h191 and h261.

Concentration and within-order SD are reported alongside.

**Code.** `gm2_self_conditioning.analyse` was split into `compute()` plus the writer. The output is unchanged, and `reproduce.py` still matches.

## D46 — Robustness wave, 2 of 3: held-out-format prediction pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 06:33 MST, before the fit. Recorded in `experiments/gm3c-heldout-format.md`. Cost $0: last night's six-format data.

**Design.** Each format is predicted from the other five by the one-credence model L1, with 5 item folds and even/odd repeats, and compared with the format's own split-half ceiling.

**Primary:** mean Q = R²_cross / R²_ceiling, read against 0.75 and 0.5.

**Check before freezing.** The code was tested on simulated data. A one-belief world gave Q = 1.06 [1.04, 1.09]; a format-specific world gave 0.21 [0.14, 0.29].

## D47 — Robustness wave, 3 of 3: the biomimetic §3.0 shared test (source × distance × lag) pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 06:37 MST, before any call. Recorded in `experiments/bm0-source-distance-lag.md`.

**Cells.**
- own and other at d = ±10 and ±60, lag 0, R = 10;
- own at ±30, lag 3, R = 20;
- reused: own ±30 lag 0 from bm1 (R = 40) and other ±30 from run 3 (R = 40).

**Budget:** $0.50, enforced in code; stop on any refusal.

**Changes from map revision 2's §3.0.**
- R = 10 rather than 20 in the new distance cells, to fit the budget.
- The lag arm at ±30 only.

**Run order.** The run waits for D45 to finish, so the two API runs do not compete. The analysis was tested on simulated data before freezing.

# Multi-model branch (`multi-model`): entries DM1–DM6

Numbered DM so as not to collide with D-entries written on `main` at the same time. Budget set by Sean: **$20** for the three replications and **$3** for the calibration demonstration, allocated here.

## DM1 — Multi-model set-up: settings, batch runner and a cost pilot

**Date:** 2026-11-04 07:45 MST, before any pre-registration on this branch.

**Settings.** The paper's runs disable thinking on Haiku. The other two models do not allow that:
- `claude-sonnet-5-5` rejects `thinking: disabled`; its thinking-off mode is `thinking: {"type": "between_tools"}`;
- `claude-opus-5-5` cannot disable thinking at any effort, so it runs at effort `low`, the minimum. Its thinking text is never returned, and no thinking block is ever placed in a later turn.

`config.PRICES` gains Opus 5.5 at $4 / $20 per million tokens.

**Batch runner.** All calls on this branch go through the Message Batches API, at 50% of list price (`experiments/mm_common.py`). The overnight stop rules are kept:
- a cap per run, checked before each batch is submitted;
- the run stops at the first refusal, with the batch ID and message ID recorded (batch results carry no HTTP request ID);
- API errors are resubmitted unchanged, at most twice;
- max_tokens hits are recorded as no answer.

**Pilot** (`results/mm-pilot-calls.json`, **$0.031**).
- Contents: 12 synchronous calls (Sonnet and Opus: two six-format prompts and a 3-turn direction-2 conversation each, with a planted and a redacted turn; one Opus base answer and one Opus matched-prompt judge call), plus a 2-request batch.
- Item: hard-pool question h002, which is not one of the 40 experiment-5 items. It is one of direction 1's 298 questions; the pilot's Opus answer to it is not used.
- Findings:
  - the batch API accepts both settings with structured outputs, and returned in about 2 minutes;
  - per call, Sonnet ≈ $0.0008 and Opus ≈ $0.0016 single-turn, ≈ $0.003 in later multi-turn turns (Opus thinks briefly there even at low effort);
  - an Opus base answer ≈ $0.011 on an easy question;
  - edited assistant turns are accepted by both models.

**Allocation of the $20** (caps at the batch rate, enforced in code; unspent cap is not moved between runs):

| run | design | cap |
|---|---|---|
| DM2, six formats, Sonnet | 80 claims × 6 × 10 | $2.20 |
| DM2, six formats, Opus | 80 claims × 6 × 10 | $4.30 |
| DM3, self-knowledge, Sonnet × Opus | Opus answers 298 questions; 3 new judge cells × 298 | $4.60 |
| DM4, transcripts, Sonnet | 10 items × 5 chains × 4 conditions × R = 4 | $2.40 |
| DM4, transcripts, Opus | same | $6.00 |
| pilot | | $0.03 |
| **total** | | **$19.53** |

## DM2 — Multi-model replication 1 of 3: six formats on Sonnet and Opus pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 07:50 MST, before any call for this test. Recorded in `experiments/mm-gm3b-format-invariance.md`.

**Design.** D38's design and analysis, unchanged, on 80 of the 160 claims: the chain claims of experiment-5 candidates 1–10 and 21–30, i.e. 10 items Haiku answered wrongly and 10 it answered rightly.

**Reference.** The Haiku reference on the same 80 claims (from D38's archive) was computed while the code was being tested, before freezing: ΔLL +19.42 [+15.40, +23.21], 86% positive.

**Secondary.** Test F′ (D46) runs on the new calls with its frozen code, which forms 3 item folds at 20 items.

## DM3 — Multi-model replication 2 of 3: self-knowledge with Sonnet × Opus pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 08:05 MST, before any call for this test. Recorded in `experiments/mm-gm1-self-knowledge.md`.

**Design.** Opus answers direction 1's 298 questions with the base prompt and base settings. Sonnet and Opus then judge each other's answers, and Opus its own, with D36's matched prompt and settings. SS is D36's archived cell.

**Primary.** I = SS + OO − OS − SO, with D36's reading.

**Not run, for budget:** the paraphrase and recognition arms.

**Cap:** $4.60 (batch rate).

## DM4 — Multi-model replication 3 of 3: transcripts on Sonnet and Opus pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 08:10 MST, before any call for this test. Recorded in `experiments/mm-gm2-self-conditioning.md`.

**Design.** D37's design and analysis, unchanged, at **R = 4**: 800 conversations per model.

**Planted values.** Set by D37's rule from each model's own first-turn ratings (16 per question), fixed after wave 1.

**Running.** Batch waves, one per turn.

**Budget fallback.** Checked after every wave; it drops a repeat index while the projected total exceeds the cap.

**Reference.** The Haiku reference at R = 4 (D37's archive, repeats 0–3) was computed while the code was being tested, before freezing: R = 2.01 [1.04, 4.43].

**Caps:** $2.40 (Sonnet) and $6.00 (Opus).

## DM4a — Opus cost above the pilot estimate: DM2's Opus run budget-stopped; DM4's Opus cap re-set before any DM4 call

**Date:** 2026-11-04 08:20 MST. No DM4 call had been made, and no DM2 answer had been looked at; only per-call costs were read.

**What happened.**
- DM2's first Opus chunk (1,600 calls) cost **$3.10**, about $0.0019 per call at the batch rate, against the $0.0009 estimate.
- The costs imply about 120 thinking tokens per call. The pilot's single-turn calls, on an easy claim of h002, had none.
- The $4.30 cap therefore stopped the run before the second chunk, as pre-registered.
- **DM2's Opus arm stands at 1,600 of 4,800 calls.** These complete 26 claims (items 1–6 and 2 claims of item 7, all items Haiku answered wrongly), plus 40 calls of a 27th claim. It is reported as budget-stopped, with D38's analysis run on the 26 complete claims and labelled as such. It is not resumed.
- Sonnet's cost per call is on the estimate ($0.0004).

**Amendment (DM4 only, Opus arm).** At this rate DM4's Opus arm would cost about $9.5 at R = 4. Its $6.00 cap would force the fallback to R = 2. DM1's rule that unspent cap is not moved between runs is therefore replaced, for this arm only:
- **DM4's Opus arm runs last,** after every other DM run has finished.
- **Its cap is fixed at its start:** $20 minus all other recorded spend on the branch (pilot, DM2, DM3, DM4 Sonnet), minus $0.10, written to `results/mm-gm2-opus-cap.json` before its first call.
- The per-wave fallback (R = 4 → 3 → 2) is unchanged.

The rule depends only on costs, and it was set before any DM4 data existed.

## DM6 — Consequence demonstration: calibration (ECE) under two formats and two question orders pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 08:35 MST, before any call for this test. Recorded in `experiments/cal-format-order.md`.

**Design.**
- Protocol: Tian et al.'s (2023) Verb. 1S top-1, verbatim (format P), and the same template with a frequency in place of the probability (format F).
- Models: Haiku and Sonnet, on the 300 hard-pool questions.
- Conditions:
  - fresh, single-question calls in two replicates;
  - ten-question conversations, in forward and reversed order (30 blocks, `random.Random(4041)`).
- ECE: 10 equal-width bins.

**Primary.** ΔECE between formats and between orders, with paired block-bootstrap CIs (seed 4042). The fresh replicate difference is the noise baseline.

**Budget.** $3, separate from the $20: caps $0.30 (Haiku) and $2.60 (Sonnet), batch rate.

**Testing.** The code was tested on random fake answers before freezing; no call had been made.

## DM2a — DM2's Sonnet arm stopped by the runner's safety factor, not by its cap; resumed in smaller chunks

**Date:** 2026-11-04 08:50 MST. Only costs had been read; no DM2 answer had been looked at.

**What happened.**
- After 3,200 of 4,800 calls ($1.36), the third 1,600-call chunk was projected at $0.85: the observed $0.000425 per call × 1.25 safety factor. That made $2.21 against the $2.20 cap, so `mm_common` refused to submit it.
- The expected cost of the chunk is about $0.68, which would end the arm at about $2.04, under its cap.

**Amendment.** The remaining 1,600 Sonnet calls are submitted in chunks of 400, each still checked against the $2.20 cap with the same factor. The cap and every other rule are unchanged. The Opus arm stays stopped (DM4a).

## DM5 — Multi-model replications: what ran and what was found

**Date:** 2026-11-04, after the runs. Summary in `results/multi-model.md`. No call was refused.

**Spend:** $16.28 of the $20. Pilot $0.03; DM2 Sonnet $2.04, Opus $3.10 (budget-stopped); DM3 $4.03; DM4 Sonnet $2.19, Opus $4.89 (DM4a cap $8.51).

**DM4's Opus fallback.** After wave 1, the projection ($8.74 at R = 3) exceeded the cap, so the fallback ran at **R = 2**. Later waves cost less per call than wave 1, so R = 3 would in fact have fitted. The rule makes the drop irreversible, which is why $3.72 is unspent.

**Readings:**

| test | Sonnet | Opus |
|---|---|---|
| DM3, self-knowledge (Sonnet × Opus pair) | **no self-advantage**, I = −0.045 [−0.107, +0.017] | (same test) |
| DM4, transcripts | **question-driven**, R = 2.95 [0.99, 12.55] | **leaning question-driven (not decisive)**, R = 0.93 [0.06, 7.31] at R = 2 |
| DM2, six formats | **mixed**, +9.22 [−1.29, +16.24], 92% positive; F′ Q 0.69, partial | **mixed** on 26 claims, +0.42 [−1.83, +2.69] |

## DM6a — Calibration demonstration: parse and referent problems found after the run; exploratory re-analysis

**Date:** 2026-11-04, after the pre-registered analysis had been run and read. Spend $2.61 of the $3 (Haiku $0.12, Sonnet $2.49).

**Pre-registered readings** (strict parse rule):
- **Haiku:** no detectable format dependence; no detectable order dependence.
- **Sonnet:** calibration depends on format (ΔECE −0.143 [−0.233, −0.066]); no detectable order dependence.

**Problems found.**
1. About 120 hard-pool questions are phrased "Is this claim true?". "Guess: True/False" answers were unparsed under the frozen yes/no rule.
2. Long worked answers hit max_tokens 300. Under the frozen rule a hit ends the conversation, so 32 Haiku and 105 Sonnet conversations ended early (23 and 66 of them fresh single calls).
3. On "Is the answer X?" questions, the models often report the probability that X is correct rather than that their guess is. How often depends on format and context.

As a result, each pre-registered cell rests on 68–199 of 300 questions.

**Exploratory, not pre-registered** (`experiments/cal_format_explore.py`, no new calls):
- True/False is mapped to yes/no, and every cell is scored under both readings of the number.
- Sonnet's format effect stays clear under Tian's intended reading (−0.083 [−0.137, −0.032]). It reverses sign under the other reading.
- Order is null in every version.
- The pre-registered readings are not changed.

## D48 — The No Credence paper's claims narrowed to what replicated on Sonnet and Opus

**Date:** 2026-11-04 09:18 MST, after merging `multi-model` (DM1–DM6) into `main`. No new data or analysis. Every number is copied from `results/multi-model.md`, `results/mm-gm1-self-knowledge.md`, `results/mm-gm2-self-conditioning.md` and `results/mm-gm3b-format-invariance.md`.

**What changed in `paper/no-credence-to-read.md`.**
- **Stated for all three models:** no privileged self-knowledge (I = −0.055 for Haiku × Sonnet; −0.045 [−0.107, +0.017] for Sonnet × Opus) and reliance on the model's own record (MF agreement shown → redacted: 78% → 25%, 88% → 35%, 95% → 65%).
- **Narrowed:** the no-format-free-credence claim now holds for Haiku, partly for Sonnet (ΔLL +9.22 [−1.29, +16.24], *mixed*; F′ Q 0.69 [0.53, 0.82], *partial*), and not for Opus (26 claims, ΔLL +0.42 [−1.83, +2.69], *mixed*).
  - The Kendall's W trend is stated: 0.54 → 0.71 → 0.86.
  - Opus's pre-registered reading is *mixed*, not *single credence*, so the paper says the claim is "not supported" on Opus, not that it is refuted.
  - Opus's W is on 26 claims, all from items Haiku answered wrongly, so the last step of the trend is not item-matched.
- **Also narrowed, for consistency:** the question-alone claim, which holds on Haiku and Sonnet and is not decisive on Opus at 2 conversations per cell.
- **Where:** a new Section 4.6 with the per-model table; the abstract, contributions, §3.1 settings, the §4.5 heading, §§5.1, 5.3 and 5.4, the limitations and the reproduction list.
- **Unchanged:** the title, the [R-pending] tags and every Haiku-only number. Test S (own against other) was run on Haiku only, and the paper does not extend it.

## D47a — Source × distance × lag: the cap stopped the lag arm at R = 17

**Date:** 2026-11-04 09:36 MST, after the run.
- **Where the cap hit.** The $0.50 cap stopped the run at 3,650 of 3,840 conversations, with $0.502 spent as calls already in flight finished.
- **Why it was short.** The lag arm's conversations (three extra turns) cost about $0.00024 each, against the $0.00015 estimated.
- **What was cut.** As pre-registered, every distance cell is complete (R = 10). The lag arm was cut to R = 17 of 20, plus 2 conversations at repeat 17.
- **The analysis** is the frozen one, run with `--analyse` because the runner exits on a cap stop before analysing. Pre-registered reading: **self-consistency**.

## D49 — Opus's six-format arm completed (54 more claims), with test F′ on all 80 pre-registered

**Date:** 2026-11-04 09:50 MST, before any call of this run. Recorded in `experiments/mm-gm3b-opus-completion.md`; code `experiments/mm_gm3b_opus_complete.py`.

**What it is.** It continues DM2, whose Opus arm was budget-stopped at 26 of 80 claims (DM4a). Sean asked for this run after the morning brief recommended it.

**Design.**
- **Unchanged from DM2:** the prompts, the settings, the cache, the analysis and test F′.
- **Batches:** one batch per item, in a fixed order alternating Haiku-right and Haiku-wrong items.
- **Size and cost:** 3,200 requests, about $6.21 at the observed rate.
- **Budget:** **$6.40 cap on new spend**, enforced in code with DM2's 1.25 projection factor; stop on any refusal.

**Readings.**
- DM2's primary rule and D46's F′ rule.
- A rule for the paper's Opus claim, frozen in its Section 4: F′ above 0.75 → "does not hold on Opus"; F′ below 0.5 with "no single credence" → "holds on Opus"; otherwise → "holds partly".

**Disclosed before freezing.**
- While testing the code, test F′ was computed on Opus's 6 already-complete items: Q = 0.96 [0.92, 0.98].
- The paper rule had been written in code before that.
- `results/mm-gm3b-opus-first26.json` freezes the arm as it stood.

**Not yet fixed in `reproduce.py`** (found in this session's run, to be fixed after the Opus run):
- `api-usage.md` differs by its price line, now that the multi-model merge added Opus's prices to `config.PRICES`;
- the five multi-model results files have no regeneration step.

## D49a — Opus completion: the runner's projection ran two batches past the frozen stopping rule; primary analysis on the 17 items the rule allows

**Date:** 2026-11-04 10:30 MST, after the run.

**What happened.**
- **The rule and the code disagreed.** The pre-registration (§3) projects each batch at 1.25 × batch size × *mean cost so far*. The code passed each batch the *previous batch's* mean cost.
- **Two batches went past the stop.** h048 was cheap (/bin/zsh.0012 per call), so the projection for h291 was $0.35, and h291 was submitted. Under the rule as written, the projection was 240 × $0.00233 × 1.25 = $0.70. With $5.78 already spent that comes to $6.48, over the cap, so the run should have stopped there. h291 then cost $0.26, and h093 was submitted on h291's low rate.
- **What I did.** I stopped the runner and cancelled h093. All 240 of its requests were cancelled with none billed (`msgbatch_01Th769st8Nr64NZWN3oqKLB`). h291 had already completed and been stored.

**Spend.**
- $6.04 of new spend: $5.78 within the rule, plus $0.26 for h291. Under the $6.40 cap.
- The whole Opus arm cost $9.14.
- No refusals, and no max_tokens stops.

**Analysis.**
- **Primary:** the frozen rule's run, 17 items (68 claims). h291 was moved out of the analysis cache into `results/mm-gm3b-opus-h291-beyond-stop.json`.
- **Sensitivity:** with h291, 18 items (72 claims), in `results/mm-gm3b-opus-completion-with-h291.md`. Every reading is identical.
- **Not run:** h093 and h183. The arm is 17 of 20 items.

**Exploratory, not pre-registered.** Kendall's W for all three models on Opus's 68 claims, using gm3b's formula (`experiments/mm_gm3b_w68_explore.py`): 0.56, 0.76 and 0.87.

**Results.**
- F′ Q = 0.94 [0.90, 0.97], *a usable single belief*.
- DM2 primary ΔLL +1.90 [−0.82, +4.65], *mixed*.
- Paper rule: **"does not hold on Opus"**.

## D50 — The No Credence paper's Opus claim narrowed from "not supported" to "contradicted", by D49's frozen rule

**Date:** 2026-11-04 10:31 MST, after D49's result (`a8be4b5`). No new data.

**The rule.** D49 froze it before any call: F′ CI wholly above 0.75 → "does not hold on Opus". The CI was [0.90, 0.97].

**What changed in `paper/no-credence-to-read.md`.**
- **Abstract and contributions:** the format claim is "contradicted on Opus", with Q 0.29 / 0.69 / 0.94 and the item-matched W 0.56 / 0.76 / 0.87.
- **Section 4.6:** the table and the Opus paragraph now use the 68-claim arm.
  - F′ 0.94 [0.90, 0.97]; ΔLL +1.90 [−0.82, +4.65], mixed; 6–14% reversed pairs.
  - The exploratory item-matched W is labelled as such.
- **Sections 5.1 and 5.3:** "On Opus there is a credence to read"; Opus's R² of 0.92 is above Smolin and Wilder's range; the reversed-pair range is updated.
- **Limitations, reproduction and costs:** D49 added ($6.04).

**Unchanged.**
- The Haiku and Sonnet numbers.
- The self-knowledge and own-record findings, which hold on all three models.
- The title.

## D51 — The audit's cuts applied to every results, README and paper file (one pass)

**Date:** 2026-11-04 MST, after the audit branch was merged (`7a5af8f`); committed in `5480c49`. No new data, and no statistic changed except where the audit found it wrong.

**Source.** `audits/SUMMARY.md` and its 41 audit files. Each audit's "Overclaims to cut" section names a target `file:line`, quotes the sentence and gives a replacement; there are 369 entries in all, on results, README and paper files. Targets were located by their quoted text, because line numbers had drifted since the audit's base commit `0c64baa`.

**Order.** The cuts were applied in the order of SUMMARY's "What the main session should cut first":
1. nulls written as findings;
2. mechanism words;
3. the named README lines;
4. the miscounts in "Numbers found wrong";
5. experiment 5's tie, which is handled separately in D52;
6. the D48 collision, already renumbered DP1 at the probes merge.

Where several audits targeted one sentence, their replacements were composed in that order into one sentence that keeps every correction.

**Counts** (per-file logs kept by the session):

| | entries |
|---|---|
| applied as written | 273 |
| adapted | 78 |
| obsolete (text already rewritten by D49/D50, defect gone) | 5 |
| left for D52 (experiment 5's verdict label) | 7 |
| deferred to the record update (Standing section, coverage line) or to D53 | 6 |

"Adapted" covers two cases:
- two audits composed onto one sentence;
- a replacement written before D49/D50, brought to the current state: Opus's format arm at 68 claims, F′ Q 0.94 [0.90, 0.97], DM2 *mixed*, item-matched W 0.56 / 0.76 / 0.87 (exploratory), "contradicted on Opus".

**Sweep.** SUMMARY's categories 1 and 2 say "every". About 134 further instances in the same files were fixed in the same style. In each, the cited data are an interval that includes 0 or a mechanism read from a behavioural contrast, so the sentence now gives the interval or says "not detected", or states the mechanism as a reading.

**Numbers corrected** (SUMMARY's "Numbers found wrong" table):
- experiment 4 run 3: the counts become 6 of 32 item-orders, 17 of 32 at 0% accept, and 5 reliable;
- gm3b: the "% of pairs" figures relabelled as the (1 − τ_b)/2 index. The shares in opposite order (11–25% split-half, 12–25% full data, against 1–5%) are given where a share is meant, and the under-converged L1 fit is noted;
- bm7: 4–9 points;
- h018's exclusion reason;
- frame-fix-check: 15% of all items;
- stage2-run-2b: arm F's window of 1–16;
- sonnet-ablation: 1,000 resamples;
- the paper's "outperforms every structural analysis" and v3's "do not differ";
- calibration: 60 True/False questions;
- the api-usage ledger's scope.

**Writer prose changed** so that the generated parts still reproduce (prose only, no computation):
- `gm3b_format_invariance.py` (the table header names the index);
- `run_pool.py` (the pool-run exclusion header; the api-usage scope line);
- `sonnet_ablation.py` (the resample count; the file is in SKIPPED).

**Other changes.**
- **No Credence paper:** the title is now "… Construct Claude Haiku's Judgments, and Partly Sonnet's". Its status line notes the few numbers taken from audit files.

**Not edited: earlier DEVIATIONS entries.** The log stays as written. The audit's corrections to it are recorded here instead:
- **D26 heading:** "fixed before any full-run data were examined" is author testimony. The analysis commit came after 606 full-run conversations existed, though before any fit or result.
- **Pool run 4 (line 376):** "1 hit the token cap" should read "1 (h018, answered correctly) was excluded because the extractor returned 1 claim".
- **DM6 (line 852):** "About 120" True/False questions should be 60, and the open-form exclusion was omitted.
- **DP1's exploratory line:** the probe's +0.14 is +0.14 [−0.23, +0.46], an association not detected rather than shown absent.

**Not edited: frozen files.** The pre-registrations in `experiments/*.md`, the audits themselves, and `experiments/probe-dissociation.md`'s line 44 (see D53).

## D52 — Experiment 5's verdict re-issued under its own §7.5 rule on the single-direction QQ statistic: TIE → CLASSICAL

**Date:** 2026-11-04 13:18 MST, after the audit (`audits/exp5-run-1.md`) and D51. No new data and no refit.

**Why.**
- Run 1's verdict, TIE (`results/exp5-run-1.md`, D22–D26, D32), took its "QQ not contradicted" leg from the mean q pooled over both scale directions: +0.005 [−0.058, +0.065].
- Run 2 (D33) and its write-up already treat that pooled value as an artefact of mixing anchors (a) and (b).
- The audit recomputed q on run 1's own anchor-(a) conversations (0 = certainly false, 100 = certainly true; all 40 items): **−0.345 [−0.517, −0.181]** on 32 large-order-effect pairs.

**The rule, unchanged.**
- §7.3: "Signature contradicted if the mean-q CI excludes 0 on those pairs."
- §7.5: "classical: primary classical, or a signature contradicted with the primary not a pass."
- The primary (§7.2) is a tie, F5 − A5 = +67.0 [−34.1, +211.5], which is not a pass. The Kvam check shows no signature and no commitment.
- So the re-issued verdict is **CLASSICAL**.

**Check with the frozen code.** `experiments/exp5_reissue.py` runs `exp5_analyse.qq_check` and the verdict precedence of `exp5_analyse.main`, unchanged, on the anchor-(a) conversations. It gives 33 pairs and −0.339 [−0.510, −0.168], also contradicted, so also CLASSICAL. The pair count differs by one from the audit's because the OE bootstrap draws differ.
- Anchor (b) is reported, not used: +0.241 [+0.118, +0.370], also contradicted.
- So the QQ equality fails in each direction separately; only the pooled average sits near 0.

**What is post hoc.** Restricting to one direction is a choice made after the data, prompted by run 2 and the audit. It is the project's single scale direction, and the subset run 2 reports, but it is not the analysis frozen in §7.3.

**Where it is recorded.**
- `results/exp5-verdict-reissue.{json,md}` (new; regenerated by reproduce.py).
- `results/exp5-run-1.md` keeps the original TIE, marked superseded, in both its generated verdict line and its Reading. The writer's prose in `exp5_analyse.write_md` changed with it; no statistic changed.
- README, record.md, the v3 paper, the programme paper and clonable-minds now give CLASSICAL (re-issued, D52), with the original tie as superseded; experiment 5 run 2's Reading marks its "run 1's tie is unchanged" as superseded. The morning brief states no experiment 5 verdict.

**Unchanged.** No quantum advantage and no quantum signature in either reading. The label moves from "could not tell apart" to "classical", because the parameter-free quantum signature is contradicted.

## D53 — The probe-dissociation result (DP1) marked unverified; a fresh step 3 on new seeds queued for the probes worktree

**Date:** 2026-11-04 13:19 MST, after the audit (`audits/probe-dissociation.md`, hole 1).

**Why.** DP1's pre-registration says selection (the gate) and test (step 3) use different conversations. But both steps seed each conversation from the same key, `seed_for(f"{lm.name}|{qid}|{cell}|{rep}")`. The audit found step 3's O1–O4 and B0 verbal ratings identical to the gate's in 500 of 500 conversations.
- So validity check V4 tested nothing.
- Step 3's verbal order effects on the gate items are the selection data, with its winner's curse.
- The frozen label, PROBE MOVES, BUT NOT WITH THE RATING, therefore rests on a test that was not independent of selection.

**What changed.**
- `results/probe-dissociation.md` (a banner under the title), README, the morning brief (a new direction-5 section) and `paper/gold-map.md` §5 (which said "Nothing yet") mark the DP1 result **unverified**.
- The figure title (`probe_dissociation_figure.py`, `paper/figures/fig3-probe-dissociation.*`) no longer says the probe moves "more than the rating does, and not in step with it"; it says "unverified, D53".
- Its numbers and label are kept, as recorded.

**Queued.** On branch `probes`, commit `ad1667d`, `experiments/QUEUED-probe-step3-fresh-seeds.md` sets out a fresh step 3:
- the same model, gate items, probe and layer, cells, R and analysis;
- sampler seeds from a new namespace (`step3-fresh`);
- a pre-run check that the fresh ratings do not replay the gate's;
- the audit's alternative Q scalings, the Holm-corrected gate and r without h191, as secondaries.

It is to be frozen as DP2 in its own commit before any run. Nothing has been run.

## D54 — Five overnight tests relabelled as exploratory re-analyses, not frozen tests

**Date:** 2026-11-04 13:20 MST, after the audit (`audits/record-accuracy.md`, `audits/SUMMARY.md` "Cross-cutting holes" 1).

**Why.** README and the morning brief said each overnight test was frozen "before its data were opened". For five of them that is false.
- **The five:** D34 (direction 9, NSIT), D35 (direction 3's anchor-gap free look), D40 (confirmation), D41 (serial position) and D42 (contrast sign).
- **What they analyse:** each re-analyses archived experiment-4 or experiment-5 conversations that earlier analyses had already opened.
- **When their plans were committed:** 15 to 90 seconds before the analysis ran.
- **What such a plan does:** it fixes the statistic against later change. It cannot keep the choice of contrast or bar blind to the data.

**What changed.**
- **README's overnight section:** six frozen tests (D36–D39, D43, D44) and five exploratory re-analyses, named.
- **The morning brief:** the rules line, the five findings' headings (items 1, 2, 7, 8, 9), the five rows of the technical table, and a note above that table.
- **Unchanged:** the analyses and their numbers.

**Not relabelled.** D46 (test F′, `gm3c`) is also an archival re-analysis of gm3b's calls; the audit counts it as the sixth of 14 with the robustness wave. The relabelling asked for covers the five overnight tests, so D46 keeps its label for now. Its own audit verdict is UNDETERMINED (`audits/gm3c-heldout-format.md`).

## D54a — D46 (test F′) relabelled as an exploratory re-analysis too

**Date:** 2026-11-04 13:48 MST, at the user's request after D54.

D46 re-analyses direction 3's six-format calls (D38), which had already been opened and analysed. Its plan was frozen with the pairwise ρ and split-half reliabilities already known (`audits/gm3c-heldout-format.md`). It is now labelled the same way as D34, D35 and D40–D42: an exploratory re-analysis, not a frozen test.
- **Where:** README (the format bullet of the overnight section), the morning brief (result 13's heading, the "Done since" note, technical-table row 13 and the note above the table) and `paper/record.md` (its row, the D54 row and the Standing section).
- **What did not change:** the numbers. Nor did D49, which applied test F′ to Opus's newly collected calls, under a rule frozen before those calls existed.

# Probes branch (`probes`): entry DP1

## DP1 — Gold map direction 5 (belief versus readout) pre-registered: local open-weight model, truth probe, chain order

*Numbering.* This entry was written as **D48** on branch `probes` (commits `9ef909d`, `8685008`), at the same time as main's D48, which narrowed the No Credence paper. It was renumbered **DP1** at the merge into `main`, after the DM precedent. References to "D48" in `experiments/probe-dissociation.md`, `experiments/probe_dissociation*.py`, `experiments/local_lm.py`, `results/probe-dissociation.md` and the two probes commit messages mean this entry. Those frozen files were left unedited.

**Date:** 2026-11-04, before any call on the study items. Recorded in `experiments/probe-dissociation.md`. Cost $0 API: Llama-3-8B-Instruct (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the fallback), 4-bit, run locally through MLX.

**Design.**
- **Step 1, the gate:** experiment 5 run 2's ten items, chains O1–O4 and B0, R = 10, one scale direction. The gate needs at least 3 items with a span of 5 points or more and an order permutation p < 0.05.
- **Step 2:** mass-mean truth probes trained on Marks & Tegmark's curated datasets. The layer is chosen on companies and counterfact.
- **Step 3:** at the M point of each chain, the probe is read on the yes-answer as a declarative statement (a cache-trimmed side branch), then the verbal rating is taken. A told-yes/told-no positive control sets each measure's range.

**Primary:** Q, the share of the noise-corrected verbal order effect that the probe also shows, in told-range units. It is read with the probe's order permutation test, against the frozen rule (§5).

**Changes from the gold map's sketch.**
- One scale direction (run 2's lesson).
- The positive control and Q were added, so that a flat probe cannot pass by being blind.
- No QQ block: the test needs only the chain orders.

**Check before freezing.** The analysis was run on simulated stable, moving and noisy-probe worlds, and returned DISSOCIATION, BELIEF MOVES and UNDECIDED respectively.

**Implementation notes after freezing (no design change).**
- **Memory limits.** The gate run slowed about 7× under system memory pressure (swap nearly full). MLX's freed-buffer cache was capped at 256 MB, and the model's memory is now wired with `mx.set_wired_limit`, as `mlx_lm.generate` does. The run was stopped and resumed twice. Conversations are keyed and seeded per (model, item, cell, repeat), and only completed repeats are saved, so resuming regenerates the same conversations.
- **Probe training memory.** Training now runs in two passes, class sums first and then projections, rather than holding every activation in memory. The statements sampled, the directions and the scores are the same.

**Result (DP1).** Llama-3-8B passed the gate at exactly 3 of 10 items (h190, h101 and h191), so Qwen was not run. The probe is layer 13, with selection AUROC 0.90 and report-set AUROC 0.88. All four validity checks pass.
- **Q = 3.72 [1.43, 7.03], r = +0.31 [−0.49, +0.99], p_P = 0.0001.**
- **Frozen verdict: PROBE MOVES, BUT NOT WITH THE RATING.**
- **Sensitivity:** layer 11 alone reads BELIEF MOVES (r = +0.60).
- **Exploratory:** the rating follows the last sub-claim's lean (r = +0.54); the probe does not (+0.14).

## D55 — qwalk (bet em-qwalk) pre-registered: a simulated quantum walk against PageRank on program 1's claim graph

**Date:** 2026-11-04 19:50 America/Denver, before the claim graph was opened for analysis. Recorded in `experiments/qwalk.md`, analysis in `experiments/qwalk.py`. Laptop only: $0 API, 0 QPU s, no chip; the walk is a numpy simulation.

**What it is.** Sean's entangled-claims question (steer st-13): program 1's research directions (`map/entangled-mind.json`) as nodes, parent, same-record-row and ledger links as edges, kills and hits as labels; a continuous-time quantum walk and personalised PageRank (damping 0.85, its exact classical twin at the matched exponential stopping time τ = 5.667) each score every settled direction leave-one-node-out. Pass only if the quantum walk's AUROC beats PageRank's with a stratified bootstrap 95% interval above 0; beating chance does not count.

**What it is not.** It does not revive the quantum error-prediction encoding (closed; CONTEXT §3 rule 6). No model answer, claim web or circuit from program 1 is used.

**Disclosed.** The author had read the map, the record and brier.md (outcomes visible) before writing the rules; no predictor was computed on the real graph and the dry run used synthetic forests only. Engine odds: map 0.04, v1 re-elicitation 0.07, in force 0.05 (lesson ls-em-qwalk). No human odds.

## D56 — em-qwalk withdrawn before data (design review: redesign); re-bet as em-qwalk2

**Date:** 2026-11-04, before any score, AUROC or Δ was computed on the real graph. Laptop only throughout: $0 API, 0 QPU s.

**Two reviews, the stricter binds** (agreed with the engine session before either verdict was known):
- `ledger/design-reviews/em-qwalk.md` (6635276, fresh subagent launched by the author's session): **redesign**. Under leave-one-node-out a hidden direction's class has one seed fewer, so its own label shapes its score. The coherent quantum superposition's mass grows with the seed count, while PageRank averages over its seeds, so the two leak in opposite directions. The leak is worst around a labelled hub, and program 1's graph is mostly one (`oe`, 19 neighbours, 29 of 41 nodes). On a star with random labels the frozen rule said "classical" in 200 of 200 graphs. "Exact classical twin (same generator, seeds, stopping time)" was also wrong on the seeding.
- `ledger/design-reviews/em-qwalk-1b.md` (3244dbb, fresh subagent launched by the engine session): **fix-first, 7 flaws**. The rule passes a walk that is below chance but less wrong than PageRank (the dry run's "quantum wins" case was exactly that), and the dumb baselines were reported, not ruled on. Other flaws: edges made after and because of outcomes; a false-pass rate measured on the wrong topology (about 4% on the real graph against the stated 2.7%); no leave-one-cluster-out; wrong nouns ("claim graph"); a review gate reading one file.

**What follows.** em-qwalk is `withdrawn` in `ledger/bets.jsonl` (counted, not scored). Its pre-registration (680f128), code and seed (34bad77) stay as committed. A new bet, em-qwalk2, takes both reviews' fixes, with its own lesson, pre-registration, seed and design reviews. Like em-qwalk, it does not revive the quantum error-prediction encoding.

## D57 — em-qwalk2 pre-registered: the re-bet of em-qwalk with both design reviews' fixes

**Date:** 2026-11-04, before any score on the real labels. Recorded in `experiments/qwalk2.md`, code `experiments/qwalk2.py`. Laptop only: $0 API, 0 QPU s.

**What changed from em-qwalk** (each review flaw is mapped to its answer in qwalk2.md §10):
- Both arms now use one-seed walks from every settled direction, summed with weights centred on the others' hit rate, so they differ only in the kernel.
- Every verdict is read against a label-permutation null on the frozen graph, which carries the leave-one-out leak (new pattern P11).
- A pass must beat chance, and the four oriented dumb rules (phase bit, neighbour vote, degree, child count).
- Added: a prospective-edges sensitivity, leave-one-cluster-out, the stated 80%-power gap (about 0.19 AUROC), seeds and inputs pinned in code, and a gate that requires both reviews.

**Inputs stay at 680f128.** The bmq scout's 18 new directions (af3266b) are reading-stage labels that postdate the question.

**Odds:** 0.05 → 0.01. Labels planted from the quantum kernel itself pass only 1–2%.
